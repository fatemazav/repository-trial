# Introduction to VMware vRealize Operations Management Pack for CloudHealth

CloudHealth is the next generation cloud management platform to manage the health of the clouds with their capacity, cost, and compliance. The VMware vRealize Operations Management Pack for CloudHealth acts as a bridge that connects vRealize Operations to CloudHealth and brings the costs of public cloud from CloudHealth into vRealize Operations Manager. This management pack enables a single-window access to all the infrastructure costs either in a private cloud, or a public cloud.
